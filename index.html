        <h1>Free Textbooks!</h1>
        <p>Are you a broke college student? Do you have a course coming up where the book is unreasonably expensive? Are you also, for entirely unrelated reasons, curious about piracy? Well, you've come to the right place!</p>
        <p>Publishers are charging ridiculous prices for books while paying authors pennies all the time, so I'd say it's morally completely fine to steal from them a little bit—especially since it cost them next to nothing in materials cost to create the eBooks we're pirating. Of course, I've never actually committed piracy and I'd never encourage anyone else to—this is just a thought experiment.</p>
        <p>Book piracy is also surprisingly easy. Unlike pirating videos, audio, or software, literature piracy usually doesn't require VPNs or torrenting software; you can even do it on your phone.</p>
        <p><strong>However</strong>, before you (hypothetically) resort to piracy, I'd strongly encourage you to look at local and campus libraries for a copy of the book you're looking for. Libraries (especially public libraries) operate based off of the number of people using their services, so if you use the library to get a textbook, you're helping them to continue to provide all the amazing services they do for their community.</p>
        <p><strong>You</strong> could pirate your textbook (or really any book!) in just a few easy steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Figure out the title, author, publication year, and possibly the edition of the book you're looking for. For example, I might be looking for the 16th edition of A Textbook I Made Up by John Doe, published in 2018.</li>
            <li>Go to one of the following sites (if these don't work or are blocked, scroll down for backup URLs):
                <ul>
                    <li><a href=https://annas-archive.org>https://annas-archive.org/</a></li>
                    <li><a href=https://libgen.rs>https://libgen.rs/</a></li>
                    <li><a href=https://singlelogin.re>https://singlelogin.re/</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Search for the book you're looking for using the information from step 1. You might need to avoid including all the information in your search query at once, and instead scroll through and look for the particular edition or year that you're looking for.</li>
            <li>Download the PDF, ePUB, or AZW3 file of the book you need! (don't worry if you can't find a download in the file format you want—we'll convert in the next step).</li>
            <li>If the file you have isn't in the format you want, you can convert it using <a href=https://cloudconvert.com/>cloudconvert</a>. If you don't feel like navigating the website, you can always just Google (or DuckDuckGo!) "cloudconvert ___ to ___".</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <p>If the sites above didn't work or were blocked for you, you can try the following URLs instead:</p>
        <p>Anna's Archive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href=https://annas-archive.se/>https://annas-archive.se</a></li>
            <li><a href=https://annas-archive.li/>https://annas-archive.li</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>LibGen (these do change from time to time and I can make no guarantee that I can keep them up to date. Google/DDG is your friend):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href=https://libgen.is/>https://libgen.is/</a></li>
            <li><a href=https://libgen.st/>https://libgen.is/</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Z-Library (otherwise known as zlib or singlelogin.re) unfortunately has no URLs other than <a href=https://singlelogin.re/>https://singlelogin.re</a></p>
